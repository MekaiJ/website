  This hackathon was run by the Google Developer Group at Eastern Washing
  University. The entire even lasted from 8:00am to 11:30pm. A notable part of
  the event was the tech talk from Gurbinder Gill, the co-founder and CPO of
  Corvic AI. This hackathon&#39;s theme was centered around the usage of AI to
  aid in creating a project.

  This was my first ever hackathon and I had an insane amount of fun. I teamed
  up with two other students at EWU, Luke Barnes and Liam Earl. We ended up
  creating a <a href="../rocketgame.html">game with working LAN multiplayer</a>,
  entirely in Java. As my group members and I jotted ideas down on the
  whiteboard, we realized we needed to prioritize features due to our time
  limit.

  We ran into a lot of problems along the way, the biggest one being version
  control. All of us had used GitHub before for personal solo projects, but none
  of use had used it collaboratively. More than once, we had pushed something to
  main and after another person had synced their project, merge conflict after
  merge conflict showed up. I found this to be an incredible learning experience
  though, because these problems motivated me to research how to use git more
  effectively in a team environment.

<p>
  In the end, I&#39;m happy to say our team won first place! This hackathon was
  a blast and I look forward to more opportunities to compete in the future.
  This experience boosted my knowledge as a programmer and has made me love
  programming even more than I did before.
